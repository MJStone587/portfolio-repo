# portfolio-repo

To learn Reactjs I used this portfolio site before working on my the final site display. Afterwards I started to grind some CSS styling to create better fluid sizing and responsive design. I perused different sites to learn some tricks that were used by others and to better read code not my own. I learned about parallax scrolling and other sizing styling for better responsive design. I ultimately did not use Parallax but it helped me better form ideas and understand styles I might use in the future.
